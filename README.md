## 📌 Key Insights Covered

### 1. Freight Analysis by Priority and Quantity Ordered
Analyzes the relationship between freight cost, shipment priority, and quantity to highlight transportation dynamics across Australia’s large geography. Reflects the challenges of wine logistics under alcohol packaging & transport regulations.

### 2. Top Products by Revenue & Quantity
Identifies best-selling wine varieties based on revenue and volume (e.g., Shiraz, Chardonnay, Cabernet) across Australia’s on-license (restaurants, bars) and off-license (retail bottle shop) markets.

### 3. Top Sub Segment
Highlights high-performing sub-categories such as sparkling wines, fortified, red blends, etc., helping stakeholders align offerings with licensing models and consumer demand in urban and regional markets.

### 4. Sales Target by City
Visualizes sales performance against targets for major Australian cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth — considering state-based liquor licensing requirements and regional consumption patterns.

### 5. Sub-Set Analysis by Revenue
Drills down into revenue by state and customer segment (domestic vs export). Reflects the impact of export incentives, retail licensing restrictions, and local tax policies on profitability.

### 6. Packing Time Analysis
Monitors order processing and packing durations across facilities, ensuring compliance with Australia’s wine labeling and packaging standards and minimizing delays before dispatch from licensed warehouses.
